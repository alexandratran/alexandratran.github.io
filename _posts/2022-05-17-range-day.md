What a fun day of guns and burgers at the Placer County Range Day on May 14!
We camped out for the day at the Spenceville Shooting Range, grilled some burgers, and went through
many boxes of ammo!
Thank you to our secretary, Pierre Carrillo, for the beautiful photos, including a set of new
headshots for our 2022 executive committee.
