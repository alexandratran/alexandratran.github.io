For our September 2023 monthly meetup, we wanted to give back to our community and do our first
trash pickup at Royer Park in Roseville!
We had a great time and plan to do more trash pickups in the future.
Thank you to all of those who came to help out.

Check out the video and photos by our secretary, Pierre Carrillo.
We also created [a video of the event](https://youtu.be/r5Vk7LQybEU?si=NqYcqZw3Ycg_jfLE) that you
can view on YouTube!
